# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: Instructional code to complete a job.

  Researched answer: A function is a set of instructions detailing how to do a task. We can use the instructions to build something over and over again, in the same way that one blueprint can be used many times to build many buildings.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: The difference is that .map() will search through an array returning a new array of the same length. While .filter() searched through an array and returns only true/false statement

  Researched answer: The .map() function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length.The .filter() function loops through an array and returns a new array with only the values that are truthy or the values that satisfy your stated condition. Filter will return a subset of the given array.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: Console.log() is an output that is useful for debugging and testing code while it is still being constructed. Return on the other hand is a command specifically requesting a defined action.

  Researched answer:



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: Arguments are external information that is passed through a function.

  Researched answer: Functions often require external information in order to run. Pieces of outside information that is used when a function runs are called arguments to that function. We put the arguments inside the parentheses of the function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when two individuals work together to navigate the construction of code. One individual is labeled the driver and physically types, constructing the code block. The other partner is the navigator and directs the driver on the construction of the code.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD is a debug tool that is similar to Psuedo coding to test code in a specific format

  Researched answer: Test Driven Development is another, and even more powerful benefit to writing tests for your code as well. When we write our tests first, then write the code required to make them pass, we as developers, are think about our code in a different, more logical way. Breaking the code into a series of tests helps us break the big problem down into much smaller ones, and smaller problems are easier to solve, so we write dramatically better code because of it.
  1.write test 2. run test suite 3. see it fail 4. write code 5. run test suite 6. pass! (7. refactor code to check for proper things)
